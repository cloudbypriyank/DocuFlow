# Usage as a Template

This documentation is designed to be easily reused for your own projects. Here's how you can get started:

## 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Start by forking this repository and then cloning it to your local machine.

## 2. Customize the Content

You can now start editing the markdown files in the `docs` directory to create your own documentation.

*   `docs/index.md`: The homepage of your documentation.
*   `docs/installation.md`: An example page. You can rename this or create new pages.

## 3. Update the Configuration

To add new pages or change the structure of your documentation, you'll need to edit `docs/.vitepress/config.js`.

### Adding a New Page

1.  Create a new `.md` file in the `docs` directory (e.g., `docs/my-new-page.md`).
2.  Open `docs/.vitepress/config.js` and add a new entry to the `sidebar` array:

    ```javascript
    { text: 'My New Page', link: '/my-new-page' }
    ```
